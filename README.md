# 100-days-of-code-challenge

Repository responsible for handling the #100DaysOfCode Challenge inspired by the challenge created by Developer Alexander Kallaway

# #100DaysOfCode Challenge by Rom√°rio Coimbra

This repository was inspired by the #100DaysOfCode challenge created by the Developer **[Alexander Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away)**.
The focus of this challenge is to program at least 1 hour a day.
The intention is to expand my knowledge through daily practice, in addition to interacting with the community that also participates in this challenge to exchange experiences and knowledge. :)
The rules are already established **[HERE](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/intl/pt-br/LEIAME.md)**

In my case, I have not yet specified what I will do each day. The idea is to create something from what you are studying at the moment.

## Resources Used During Development

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**

My intention is to further improve my skills in **JavaScript** and **PHP**.
