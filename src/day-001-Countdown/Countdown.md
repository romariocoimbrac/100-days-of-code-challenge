# 100 Days Countdown

My first project was to create a countdown of how long it will take me to complete this challenge.
Today is 09/22/2020 and there are exactly 100 days left for the year to end! :)

During the challenge I learned a little more about the javascript **Date** global object, and about DOM manipulation to create the countdown.
