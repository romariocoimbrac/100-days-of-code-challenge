# Pomodoro Timer

The main idea of ​​this project is to create a timer that implements the pomodoro technique. The setting will be 25 minutes for each focus time and 5 minutes each interval, plus a counter for each completed cycle

In this challenge, I practice how to reuse some functions and how to manipulate time on JavaScript.
